# Vanilla Javascript Trading Game
This is a simple trading game built using Vanilla JavaScript. In the game, you play as a trader who must buy and sell stocks to earn a profit. You start with a fixed amount of cash and can use that money to purchase shares of different stocks. The stock prices change randomly over time, so you must watch the market and make decisions about when to buy and sell.

The game includes a user interface with buttons for buying and selling stocks, as well as a chart that displays the historical stock prices. You can see your current cash balance and the value of your stock portfolio, as well as your total profit or loss.
